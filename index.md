Welcome to **Nairuby**, a user group for [Ruby][5] programmers based in
[Nairobi, Kenya][nairobi-kenya-map]. We welcome all programmers of all levels,
from beginner to advanced!

As a hacker group we promote the [Open Source][11] Culture and whenever we can,
we organise meetings to share knowledge, code and our enthusiasm for programming
in Ruby.

## Participate

There are many ways to participate in Nairuby:

* **Attend our meet-ups:** we have a number of regular meet-ups that
  everyone is welcome to attend:

    * **General meetings** for formal presentations, lightning talks and group
    discussions on topics of interest to those working with Ruby. Meetings are
    usually the first Tuesday of the month, _"Ruby Tuesday"_. Let us know if
    you're interested in presenting.

    * **Beginner's meetings** for one-on-one help. Programmers with any level of
    Ruby experience are welcome at these so they can get and offer help at
    these. Happens every week except the first week of the month.

    * **Lunch meetings** to hang out and meet fellow Ruby enthusiasts.
    Occurs every last Wednesday of the month.
