Interested in presenting at Nairuby? We would love to have you!

### Quick Tips

Here's what to do:

1. Send a quick note to the [mailing list][mail-list] and we'll let you know
when there's room on the schedule. We aim to announce speakers about one week
before the monthly meeting.

2. Prepare your presentation. This can be anything from a quick lightning talk
with whiteboard drawings to an hour-long talk with 200 well-designed slides.

3. Show up and share your knowledge! If you need the projector, be sure to bring
any adapters you need to connect e.g. VGA, HDMI and DVI connectors especially
for the Mac users.

If you're not quite ready to present, you can submit your name to the potential
presenters list via [mailing list][mail-list] and we'll check in with you
occasionally.

### Help us find speakers!

We're always on the lookout for speakers for Nairuby meetings, so if you know
someone you'd like to see present, please make an introduction. You can also add
to the list of suggested presentations if there's a topic you'd like to learn
more about.
